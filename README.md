# Spectra4.0 Hackathon Project

## Inspiration
#### We often times buy clothes just for one event and never wear it again. Why not buy from already worn clothes from those in your community to not only support your community members but also the environment? Garage sales do just that, but it is often a hassle to hold in person garage sales. This is why we decided to create VRAGE, an online platform for community members to come together to buy what they need and sell what they don't all while reducing the amount of clothes that go into landfills each day.

## What it does
#### Connect sellers and buyers in an area

## How I built it
#### Bootstrap, TypeformAPI, HTML, CSS, JS We used JavaScript to get the response from the Response API from Typeform. This would give us all the responses from people who are selling items. We connected this with our listings page to show these items and their details.

### Note:
##### Needed to add a chrome extension for CORS to be able to run in browser. We used Moesif Orign & CORS Changer Chrome Extension
